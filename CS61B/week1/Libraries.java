//lots of librabries out there
//built-in Java: Math, String, Integer, List, Map
//Princeton standard: StdDraw, StdAudio

//as a programmer, you'll want to leverage existing libraries whenever possible
//save the trouble of writing code and less buggy.
//downside: have to learn the libraries. An axe (your own code) is familiar and
//easy to use but if you learn how to use a chainsaw, it's much much more efficient.

//best way to use unfamiliar libraries:
//find a tutorial (web, youtube,...)
//read documentation
//look at example code snippets that use the library
