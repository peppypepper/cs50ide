// arrays: insert is bad, delete is bad, search is great random acess, sort is easy (linear, bubble,..), small memory size, fixed size no flexibility
// linked lists: insert is easy, delete is easy, search is bad, sort is hard, small size wise
// hash table: insert is easy, delete is easy, search is better than linked list because we use multiple linked lists, sort is hard, gamut of size
// tries: insert is complex, delete is easy, serach is fast, already sorted, really large size
